## About me

üëã Hi, I'm Marco! 

I'm currently a Senior SDE and Solutions Architect at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), with a special love for building tools, automating everything, and spreading the DevOps Culture. 

I have been in touch with programming **since 2009** and consider myself a **proficient developer** capable of building and maintaining **production-grade** web applications. I am highly skilled in the **TypeScript** stack, but I also have experience building applications in many other environments, such as Python, Golang, Lua, Java, and Kotlin.

Besides working and contributing to open-source projects, I‚Äôm also a mentor, code craftsman, and career advisor for new developers at [PodCodar](https://podcodar.com), which is a Non-Profit Community that helps people build their careers in a Digital world.
