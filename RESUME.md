## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marco!

I'm a Software Engineer, and DevOps enthusiast, in contact with code since 2009.
Most of my experience comes from building frontend-heavy applications, and working
extensively with TypeScript, Node.js, and React. However, I enjoy wearing many hats in my
career, so I have also gained interesting experience working as a Backend Engineer and
Cloud Architect, creating services for high availability at great companies, including Amazon.

Currently, I spend my free time assisting in the development of new developers' careers at
[PodCodar](https://podcodar.com) and contributing to various Open Source Projects, such as Deno, Fresh and Aleph.js.
