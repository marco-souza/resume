## About me

üëã Hi, I'm Marco, a software developer passionate about building tools that make a difference.

Since **2009**, I've been looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills and the world around me. I've developed a broad skill set that includes TypeScript, Python, Golang, Lua, Java, Kotlin, and Elixir. Whether working on a new project or mentoring others, I'm driven by a desire to make a positive impact.

I'm also the founder and leader of PodCodar - a nonprofit learning community that believes tech education should be inclusive and accessible to all, and we're committed to making that a reality in Brazil and beyond.
