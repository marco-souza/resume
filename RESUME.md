# Marco AntÃ´nio

> Tech Lead and Software Engineer

## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marco! I'm a Software Engineer and Tech Leader with a DevOps focus. I have been involved with coding since 2009.

While much of my experience comes mostly from building frontend-heavy applications, I have also gained interesting experience working as a backend engineer and cloud architect. In these roles, I created services for high availability at great companies, including Amazon.

I have extensive experience working with **TypeScript, Node.js, and React**, but I enjoy wearing many hats in my career.

Currently, I spend my free time assisting in the development of new developers' careers at [PodCodar](https://podcodar.com) and contributing to various Open Source Projects, such as [Deno](https://deno.land), [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev), and [Aleph.js](https://aleph.deno.dev).
