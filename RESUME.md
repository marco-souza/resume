## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marco!

I'm a Software and Cloud Engineer, with a DevOps advocate, in contact with code since 2009.

Most of my experience comes from building frontend-heavy applications, and working extensively with **TypeScript, Node.js, and React**. However, I enjoy wearing many hats in my career, so I have also gained interesting experience working as a Backend Engineer and Cloud Architect, creating services for high availability at great companies, including Amazon.

Currently, I spend my free time assisting in the development of new developers' careers at [PodCodar](https://podcodar.com) and contributing to various Open Source Projects, such as [Deno](https://deno.land), [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev), and [Aleph.js](https://aleph.deno.dev).
