## Core Principles

### 1. Keep It Short

- **Target: 1 page maximum** (exceptions: engineering roles with many projects = 2 pages acceptable)
- Concision and precision are key
- Google explicitly states: "Think twice before letting your resume move onto multiple pages"
- No objective or summary section at the top (waste of space - resume IS the summary)

### 2. The X-Y-Z Formula (Critical)

**Format:** "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"

This is the foundation of Google resume writing. Every major achievement should follow this pattern.

**Why it matters:** Google is data-driven. They expect employees to think with data. Your resume must reflect this mindset.

#### Examples:

**Weak → Better → Best:**

1. "Member of Leadership for Tomorrow Society"
   - Better: "Selected as one of 275 for this 12-month professional development program"
   - Best: "Selected as one of 275 participants nationwide for 12-month professional development program based on leadership potential and academic success"

2. "Won second place in hackathon"
   - Better: "Won second place out of 50 teams in hackathon"
   - Best: "Won second place out of 50 teams in hackathon by developing mobile calendar sync app with 2 colleagues"

3. "Grew revenue for SMB clients"
   - Better: "Grew revenue for SMB clients by 10% QoQ"
   - Best: "Grew revenue for 15 SMB clients by 10% QoQ by mapping new software features to their business goals"

## What Google Looks For

### During Resume Screening:

1. **Polished Application**
   - Attention to detail is critical
   - One typo = automatic rejection (you're demonstrating your product quality)
   - Professional formatting = respect for the reviewer's time

2. **Quantifiable Impact, Contributions, Accomplishments**
   - Measured results: sales increases, patents, academic awards
   - Concrete numbers: percentages, time saved, scale achieved
   - No vague language ("improved," "optimized," "enhanced" without numbers)

3. **Clear Timeline of Employment**
   - Chronological order matters
   - Employment gaps are NOT deal-breakers (research shows bias against this is unfair)
   - Include dates for all positions: MMM/YYYY – MMM/YYYY

4. **Leadership Signals** (even if not a formal leader)
   - Led a project or initiative
   - Took initiative or ownership
   - Influenced other people
   - Mentored or trained teammates
   - Google wants leaders at all levels, not just task executors

5. **Technical Skills Prominently Displayed** (for technical roles)
   - Programming languages listed at top
   - GitHub/portfolio links near contact info
   - Tech stack for each major project

## Formatting Rules

### DO:

- ✅ Save as **PDF** (consistent rendering across devices)
- ✅ Use **black text** on white background
- ✅ Font: **Arial or Calibri**, size **10-12pt**
- ✅ **Bullet points** for readability (not paragraphs)
- ✅ **Consistent formatting** throughout
- ✅ **Adequate white space** (don't overcrowd)
- ✅ **Prominent contact info** (name, email, phone, GitHub if engineer)
- ✅ **Action verbs** at the start of each bullet (Led, Built, Reduced, Increased, Implemented)
- ✅ **Proofread multiple times** - read in reverse to catch spelling errors

### DON'T:

- ❌ No objective or summary section
- ❌ No fancy fonts, colors, graphics, or emojis
- ❌ No long paragraphs (use bullets)
- ❌ No external images or non-standard formatting
- ❌ No typos or grammatical errors
- ❌ Don't waste space on self-evident facts
- ❌ Don't include things that require explanation without context
- ❌ Don't go beyond 2 pages (and really try for 1)

## Resume Structure (Recommended Order)

### For Experienced Professionals (2+ years in workforce):

1. **Personal Information**
   - Name (largest font)
   - Email, Phone, LinkedIn, GitHub (if applicable)

2. **Work Experience** (reverse chronological)
   - Company, Title, Dates
   - 3-5 bullet points per role (X-Y-Z format)
   - Focus on impact, not tasks

3. **Education**
   - Degree, School, Graduation Date
   - GPA (only if 3.7+, and only if recent)
   - Relevant coursework or honors (if recent grad)

4. **Leadership and Awards**
   - Volunteer leadership
   - Awards and recognition
   - Major accomplishments outside day job

5. **Optional Final Section**
   - Technical skills (if not mentioned in experience)
   - Languages
   - Certifications
   - Projects or open source

### For Recent Graduates:

1. **Personal Information**
2. **Education** (move to top)
3. **Work Experience**
4. **Leadership and Awards**
5. **Optional: Projects, Extracurriculars, Languages**

## Key Metrics to Quantify

When describing achievements, include specific metrics:

- **Time savings:** "Reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 26 minutes"
- **Scale:** "Supported 10k+ simultaneous connections"
- **Performance:** "Improved page speed by 40%"
- **Memory/Resource:** "Reduced memory usage from 80MB to 15MB"
- **Latency:** "Achieved <150ms latency"
- **Adoption:** "Reached millions of users"
- **Percentage improvements:** "Cut time-to-market from 3 months to 1.5 months"
- **Team impact:** "Managed and mentored 6 direct reports"

**Rule:** If you can't quantify it, question whether it belongs on the resume.

## Customization Strategy

- **Write a new resume for each position** - tailor to job description
- Match keywords from job posting
- Prioritize achievements relevant to the role
- Lead with most relevant experience
- If space is tight, remove or deprioritize older/less relevant positions

---

## Red Flags Google Avoids

- Unexplained employment gaps (gaps are OK if recent)
- Inconsistent date formatting
- Vague accomplishments without metrics
- Spelling or grammar errors
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Overly long descriptions (one bullet = one line max)
- "Responsibilities" instead of "Accomplishments"

---

## Pro Tips from Google Recruiters

1. **Use shorthand carefully** - Only use abbreviations (QoQ, ROI, etc.) if 100% certain reviewer will understand

2. **Start each bullet with action verb**
   - Achieved, Built, Created, Designed, Developed, Discovered, Implemented, Improved, Increased, Led, Managed, Mentored, Optimized, Reduced, Spearheaded

3. **Include programming languages with projects** (for engineers)
   - Shows expertise level and tech diversity
   - Helps with parsing and keyword matching

4. **One line per bullet point**
   - If it spills to second line, rewrite it shorter
   - Space is premium on a single page

5. **Link to portfolio/GitHub**
   - Engineers: GitHub link mandatory at top
   - Designers: Portfolio link at top
   - Product managers: Data portfolio or case studies
